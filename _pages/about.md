Welcome! I am a computer science and mathematics undergraduate with a strong focus on robotics, perception, and high-performance systems, working at the intersection of autonomous systems, computer vision, and applied optimization. My work spans the full stack of robotic systems, from low-level hardware integration and real-time communication to perception pipelines, state estimation, and algorithmic design.

I am deeply involved in autonomous aerial and underwater robotics, with hands-on experience developing and deploying ROS 2–based systems on real vehicles. This includes perception-driven tasks such as visual pose estimation, object detection, and geometric inference, as well as system-level integration involving PX4, DroneCAN, GNSS/RTK, DDS networking, and embedded compute platforms such as Nvidia Jetson devices. I place particular emphasis on robustness, timing, and performance in real-world deployments.

My interests also include high-performance and scientific computing. I have worked on parallelization, low-latency data pipelines, and performance optimization in C++ and Python, with attention to efficiency, numerical stability, and reproducibility. I am comfortable working across simulation and real hardware, and I frequently design tooling and infrastructure to support rapid experimentation and debugging.

Beyond coursework, I have led and contributed to competitive and research-oriented engineering teams, including international autonomous robotics competitions, where I have been involved in system architecture, algorithm design, and end-to-end validation under operational constraints. I am motivated by problems that require both theoretical rigor and practical engineering, particularly in autonomous systems operating in complex, uncertain environments.
